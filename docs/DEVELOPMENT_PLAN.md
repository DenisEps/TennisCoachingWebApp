# Development Plan for MVP

This document outlines the step-by-step development plan for the MVP version of the tennis coaching app. Each step represents a distinct phase or task to achieve a functional MVP.

## 1. Project Setup & Environment Configuration
- **Initialize Project Repository:**  
  - Set up version control (e.g., Git) and define the project structure.
- **Configure Development Environment:**  
  - Install necessary tools: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest.
  - Organize project folders

## 2. Backend & Database Setup
- **Supabase Setup:**  
  - Create a Supabase project for authentication, database, and storage.
- **Deploy SQL Schema:**  
  - Use the provided SQL schema (in `docs/DatabaseSchema.sql`) to set up the database.
- **Configure Security:**  
  - Set up Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure data isolation for coaches and clients.

## 3. User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control
- **Implement Email Sign-Up Flow:**  
  - Utilize Supabase Auth for email-based sign-up.
- **Simplified Login Flow:**  
  - Create login buttons for Coach and Client (without a full authentication process for MVP).
- **Role-Based Access:**  
  - Ensure the application serves different dashboard views based on user roles.

## 4. Coach Availability Module
- **User Interface for Availability:**  
  - Develop screens for coaches to set and manage their availability (select days of the week and set start/end times).
- **Backend Integration:**  
  - Create endpoints or Supabase functions to store and retrieve availability data.

## 5. Session Management Module
- **Booking Flow:**  
  - Enable clients to select a coach, choose a date/time slot, and confirm a booking.
- **Cancellation & Notifications:**  
  - Implement session cancellation and notify both coaches and clients.
- **Record Session Details:**  
  - Store session status, start/end times, and the offline payment flag.

## 6. Email Notifications & Reminders
- **[POSTPONED for Post-MVP]** Email notifications setup will be implemented after MVP launch
- Focus on core functionality first

## 7. Frontend Development for User Flows
- **Design & Build Screens:**  
  - **Landing/Welcome Screen:** ✅ Options for login as Coach or Client

  - **Client Dashboard:** ✅ Display upcoming sessions, session history, and booking interface
  - **Coach Dashboard:** ✅ Display today's sessions, upcoming sessions, availability settings
  - **Booking & Session Details Pages:** ✅ Interfaces for booking, cancellation, and session overview
  - **News Feed Page:** A placeholder for coaches to post news and announcements
- **Mobile-First Design:**  
  - Ensure all screens are optimized for mobile and are responsive across devices

## 8. Common Screens & Error Handling
- **Help/Support Pages:**  
  - Develop support, FAQs, and contact information page.
- **Error & Loading States:**  
  - Implement visual feedback for loading states, connection issues, and data fetch errors.

## 9. Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Write unit tests for critical functions and components using Jest.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Conduct tests for key user flows (e.g., authentication, booking, and session management).
- **Manual QA:**  
  - Perform manual testing to identify and fix edge cases and usability issues.

## 10. Code Quality & Documentation
- **Enforce Coding Standards:**  
  - Use ESLint and Prettier to ensure code consistency.
- **Maintain Documentation:**  
  - Update project documentation (Context.md, DatabaseSchema.sql, etc.) throughout development.
- **CI Integration:**  
  - Set up continuous integration tools for automated testing and linting (if applicable).

## 11. Deployment & Environment Configuration
- **Deploy Frontend:**  
  - Deploy the frontend on Vercel or a similar hosting provider.
- **Configure Backend:**  
  - Ensure Supabase is properly configured and connected.
- **Secure Environment Variables:**  
  - Manage API keys and service credentials securely.

## 12. Final QA & MVP Release
- **Final Testing:**  
  - Perform a final round of QA, fix bugs, and complete user acceptance testing.
- **Prepare Release Documentation:**  
  - Document release notes and update relevant documentation.
- **MVP Launch:**  
  - Launch the MVP and monitor for feedback and issues.
